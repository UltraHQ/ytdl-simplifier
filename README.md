# ytdl-simplifier
Downloads youtube mp3/video, but without overloading you with arguments/options/decisions.<br>

### Requirements:
<b> -> [youtube-dl.exe](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) in the same directory as the .bat</b></br>
<b> -> [FFmpeg](https://gist.github.com/barbietunnie/47a3de3de3274956617ce092a3bc03a1) installed </b>

Simply choose whether you want to download as a video or sound only, and it will automatically choose the best quality passing all the needed arguments.

You probably know this already, but in case you didn't - This was scripted in batch, so it only supports windows.

I primarly made it for myself, it's a really basic script in a really basic language, but I thought others may also want to use it.
