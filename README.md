# ytdl-simplifier
Downloads youtube mp3/video, but without overloading you with arguments/options/decisions.<br>
<b> -> Needs to have youtube-dl.exe in the same directory as the .bat</b>

Simply choose whether you want to download as a video or sound only, and it will automatically choose the best quality passing all the needed arguments.

You probably know this already, but in case you didn't - This was scripted in batch, so it only supports windows.
